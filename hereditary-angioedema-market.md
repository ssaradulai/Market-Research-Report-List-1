<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hereditary Angioedema Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>C1 Esterase Inhibitor</li><li>Kallikrein Inhibitor</li><li>Selective Bradykinin B2 Receptor Antagonist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) market encompasses three main treatment types: C1 Esterase Inhibitors, Kallikrein Inhibitors, and Selective Bradykinin B2 Receptor Antagonists. C1 Esterase Inhibitors supplement the deficient protein, preventing angioedema attacks. Kallikrein Inhibitors work by blocking the enzyme responsible for producing bradykinin, a key mediator of swelling. Selective Bradykinin B2 Receptor Antagonists prevent bradykinin from binding to its receptors, thereby reducing the severity and frequency of angioedema episodes. Together, these therapies aim to enhance patient outcomes in HAE management.</p></p>
