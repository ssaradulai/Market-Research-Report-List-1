<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drains/Wound Drainage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical drains and wound drainage market is primarily divided into two types: passive drains and active drains. Passive drains rely on gravity or capillary action to remove fluid from a wound, using open-ended systems that allow drainage without suction. In contrast, active drains utilize suction mechanisms, such as vacuum systems, to actively remove fluid, thereby preventing fluid accumulation and promoting healing. Each type serves distinct clinical needs and is chosen based on surgical procedure requirements and patient conditions.</p></p>
