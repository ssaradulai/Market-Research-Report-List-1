<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Harmonic Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Harmonic Filter</li><li>Passive Harmonic Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The harmonic filter market is divided into two main types: active harmonic filters and passive harmonic filters. Active harmonic filters dynamically adjust to varying power quality conditions, effectively cancelling out harmonics by injecting counter-phase currents. They are ideal for applications requiring real-time response to fluctuating loads. Conversely, passive harmonic filters use fixed components, such as inductors and capacitors, to absorb specific harmonic frequencies, offering a cost-effective solution for static loads. Both types enhance power quality, reduce energy losses, and protect equipment.</p></p>
