<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Plant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power plants are categorized mainly into three types. Dry steam stations utilize steam directly from geothermal reservoirs to drive turbines, making them the simplest and most efficient design. Flash steam power stations extract high-pressure geothermal fluids, allowing rapid pressure drop to produce steam, which powers turbines. Binary cycle stations transfer heat from geothermal fluids to a secondary liquid with a lower boiling point, generating steam to drive turbines without directly using the geothermal water, improving efficiency and environmental safety.</p></p>
